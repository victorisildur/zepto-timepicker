Yes, that's all!
No css is required because they are built in by webpack.

It's webpack, browserify compatible, the plugin only depends on '$'.

# Comments

Sorry for no pictures and demos, coming soon.

However, $ needs to be a global symbol now, so it has some problem with webpack.
It can be solved by using webpack.ProvicePlugin, which provide $ as a global symbol.
